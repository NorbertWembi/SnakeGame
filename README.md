# Snake Game

A simple Java-based Snake Game built as a personal project to practice and strengthen my Java programming skills. It uses Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI).
The game implement different features such as snake movement, collision detection, apple generation, and score tracking. 

The game can be close using: https://github.com/norbertWembi/SnakeGame 

## Game Flow
Start: Just after running the game, a window appears with a white background, and the snake starts moving to the right
Eat Apples: The snake grows longer every time it eats an apple, and the score increases.
Collision Detection: The game will stop if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.
Game Over: Once the game ends, a "Game Over" message is displayed along with the final score.

## Purpose
This project was created to improve my understanding of: object-oriented programming in Java, event handling and keyboard input (directions), basic game loops and rendering, implementing collison detection in 2D space, and building interactive user interfaces with Java Swing

## Upcoming Improvemnt
There are a set of features I plan to add on this project to make it more professional. These are: 
* Giving Player ability to pause and resume it later
* Increasing the snake's speed automatically as the player progresses
* Tracking and displaying highest score across mutliple sessions
* Adding player's name at the end of the game with the highest score
