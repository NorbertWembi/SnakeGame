#Snake Game

A simple Java-based Snake Game built as a personal project to practice and strengthen my Java programming skills. 
The game features classic snake mechanics, keyboard controls, and basic collision logic—all implemented using core Java concepts.

##Features
Classic snake movement and food mechanics
Score tracking
Game-over detection
Built using only plain Java (no external game engines)

##Purpose
This project was created to improve my understanding of:
Object-oriented programming in Java
Event handling and keyboard input (directions)
Basic game loops and rendering
Managing state within small interactive applications
